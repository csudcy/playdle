# Playdle

Started from https://github.com/sijey-praveen/MySpotify/tree/Sijey/MySpotify


## Running

Easiest way to run is:
```
cd docs
python3 -m http.server
```
Then load http://localhost:8000


## Todo
* Bug: Sometimes next track doesn't move next

Later:
* Guess
* Keep score
* Choose playlist/album (use Spotify for now)
